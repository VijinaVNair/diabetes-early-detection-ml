## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide, often leading to severe complications if undiagnosed or unmanaged. Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive, time-consuming, and costly. This project aims to develop a non-invasive, efficient, and accurate machine learning model for early detection of diabetes, leveraging IBM Cloud and Watson Studio.

## Problem Statement

There is a critical need for a scalable, non-invasive, and accurate method for early diabetes detection. Current diagnostic methods are not only invasive but also require significant time and resources, limiting their accessibility.

---

## Objective

To develop and evaluate a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health indicators and demographic data, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
